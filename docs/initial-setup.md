# Install the library

`npm install --save react-native-firebase`

# Initial Setup

The RNFirebase library is intended on making it easy to work with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and provides a small native shim to the Firebase native code.

To add Firebase to your project, make sure to create a project in the [Firebase console](https://firebase.google.com/console)
